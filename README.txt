Introduction:
This README file provides instructions for replicating the results of the empirical analysis presented in the paper "Drought-reliefs and Partisanship". The package includes data files and code to run the analysis. The code generates tables and figures in the paper.

Files Organization:
The replication package includes two main folders: "data" and "analysis". The "data" folder contains the data files used in the analysis. The "analysis" folder contains the code to run the analysis and generate the tables and figures.

To replicate the results, please follow these steps:

1- Download and extract the replication package to a folder of your choice.

2- Open the code file (Main_analysis.do) located in the folder (.\analysis\code) using your preferred Stata software.

3- Set the working directory to the folder where the replication package has been extracted.

4- Change the path to the main analysis folder specified at line 14 in the code file to the directory where the replication package is located.

5- Install any required packages specified at lines 36-47 in the code file.

6- Run the Main_analysis.do do-file to generate the results. The output files (both in png and tex format) will be saved automatically in the folder (.\analysis\output).

Data files:
The "data" folder contains the dataset folder (.\data), which includes municipality-level variables for the years 1996, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020. The file "database.do" in the folder (.\data) contains the code to load the data files used in the analysis.

Note: The replication package assumes that the necessary software is installed on your computer to run the analysis.
